The almond past inside gave it enough sweetness too! Absolutely delicious! The ambiance is gorgeous too!

There's only a small sign on Walnut Street directing you down a random side street alley, Sydenham Street, and there is only a simple sign on the door. Despite the minimal advertising, word of mouth gets around, Elixr is the best. It's a perfect cafe setting with a rustic industrial vibe with a hipster/millenial feel to it.
